what i've learnt during project:

getting to grips with eigen library

declaring cumsum template function in header, implementation in source file... linking problems. have to define in header file instead

create function to parse csv and map to eigen array

lambda function/captures

cmake
- for usage with mingw, add this flag when building with cmake (first time): -G "MinGW Makefiles"
- use mingw32-make
